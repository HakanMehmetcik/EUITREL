<h1>Teaching Program: Implementation and Content</h1>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Implementation phase goes through the Spring Semester 2022 up to Spring Semester 2025 (total of 3 years). During this phase, there will be implementation of 36 (108 hours) lectures and 36 (108 hours) seminars given by the project team.</p>
<p>The main objective of the methodological approach(es) employed in teaching activities is to provide a greater theoretical appreciation of the changing nature of regionalism and importance of inter-regional and trans-regional relations in EU studies. To this end, the project team will conduct both an analytical and conceptual investigation of the issue and develop a conceptual and historical approach to the study of EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations. Our teaching will focus on the following research topics: - definition of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - theories and approaches of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - causes and outcomes of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - different cases of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - analysis of EU’s inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism with different cases.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Regionalism and EU</p>
<p><strong>Prof.&nbsp;in charge:</strong> Prof.&nbsp;Erhan Dogan</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This course is an introductory course on the phenomenon of regionalism by taking the EU as both reference case study for regional cooperation and as an international policy actor strengthening multi-layered multilateral cooperation. The lecture starts with the fact that globalization and regionalism are now not only economic but also multidimensional and political processes. In this sense, to understand the role of the EU in this new environment, we have to go beyond classical approaches and understanding of regionalism.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Inter-regional Relations between EU and North and Latin America</p>
<p><strong>Prof.&nbsp;in charge:</strong> Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Hakan Mehmetcik</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This lecture is an introductory lecture on inter-regional relations between EU and North America. Euro-Atlantic relations are historically very important and institutionalized one even though there are rifts and problems between the US and some EU countries. The recent EU-Canada FTAs is also important in this sense. However, there are very little, if there is at all, inter-regional relations between the EU and NAFTA (UMSCA). That also derives from the fact that NAFTA and EU is totally different phase of regionalism (one is a regional FTA while the other is a full-regional-integration). However, this is very different when it comes to EU and Latin American Relations. European Union Member States and the Latin American countries committed themselves to reinforcing the existing strategic partnership between the European Union and Latin America. Thus, this lecture will cover both EU’s relations with individual North American countries (Mexico, Canada but not the US since it is dealt with another lecture in this series) and EU’s interregional relations with Latin America. The focus will be on the later.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Inter-regional Relations in Eurasia</p>
<p><strong>Prof.&nbsp;in charge:</strong> Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Hakan Mehmetcik</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s inter-regional relations with Eurasian ROs including the new emerging Chinese Belt and Road Initiatives. Eurasia is a fertile ground for geo-political rivalry not just in terms of security and politics but also trade and regionalism. In this sense, there are three rival visions of regionalism that have an effect on regional outlooks in Eurasia. The first one, the Russian led regionalism institutionalized under Eurasian Economic Union, and CSS. The second one is EU’s aspirational regionalism that can be found aspirations of the countries for joining the EU. The last and recent one is China led Belt and Road Initiative. Thus, in this regional dynamics, the EU does not just conduct inter-regional relations but also actively rivals those ROs. This lecture provides a fresh perspective to analyse the actors, dynamics and outputs of EU’s inter-regional relations in Eurasia.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Trans-regional Relations between EU and USA</p>
<p><strong>Prof.&nbsp;in charge:</strong> Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;İmran Demir</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This lecture is an introductory lecture on the EU and the USA trans-regional relations. There is a historical context, especially in terms of security through NATO, of the EU’s transatlantic relations with the USA. The trade is also an important dynamic.
