    "text": "Implementation phase goes through the Spring Semester 2022 up to Spring Semester 2025 (total of 3 years). During this phase, there will be implementation of 36 (108 hours) lectures and 36 (108 hours) seminars given by the project team.\nThe main objective of the methodological approach(es) employed in teaching activities is to provide a greater theoretical appreciation of the changing nature of regionalism and importance of inter-regional and trans-regional relations in EU studies. To this end, the project team will conduct both an analytical and conceptual investigation of the issue and develop a conceptual and historical approach to the study of EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations. Our teaching will focus on the following research topics: - definition of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - theories and approaches of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - causes and outcomes of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - different cases of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - analysis of EU’s inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism with different cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Regionalism and EU\nProf. in charge: Prof. Erhan Dogan\nDescription: This course is an introductory course on the phenomenon of regionalism by taking the EU as both reference case study for regional cooperation and as an international policy actor strengthening multi-layered multilateral cooperation. The lecture starts with the fact that globalization and regionalism are now not only economic but also multidimensional and political processes. In this sense, to understand the role of the EU in this new environment, we have to go beyond classical approaches and understanding of regionalism.\n\nRegionalism: A conceptual Framework\nTheoretical Discussions on Regionalism I: Classic Theories\nTheoretical Discussions on Regionalism II: Critical Theories\nEU as a Regional Integration I: 1945-1990\nEU as a Regional Integration II: 1990-2008\nEU as a Regional Integration III: What lies Ahead?\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: Inter-regionalism\nProf. in charge: Assoc.

The role of these informal groups has been increasing since the 2008 financial crisis. Especially, studying these groups and their effects on the global economy and global governance via G20, and UN has become one of the most important dynamics in international politics.

Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on inter-regional relations between EU and North America. Euro-Atlantic relations are historically very important and institutionalized one even though there are rifts and problems between the US and some EU countries. The recent EU-Canada FTAs is also important in this sense. However, there are very little, if there is at all, inter-regional relations between the EU and NAFTA (UMSCA). That also derives from the fact that NAFTA and EU is totally different phase of regionalism (one is a regional FTA while the other is a full-regional-integration). However, this is very different when it comes to EU and Latin American Relations. European Union Member States and the Latin American countries committed themselves to reinforcing the existing strategic partnership between the European Union and Latin America. Thus, this lecture will cover both EU’s relations with individual North American countries (Mexico, Canada but not the US since it is dealt with another lecture in this series) and EU’s interregional relations with Latin America.

Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s inter-regional relations with Eurasian ROs including the new emerging Chinese Belt and Road Initiatives. Eurasia is a fertile ground for geo-political rivalry not just in terms of security and politics but also trade and regionalism. In this sense, there are three rival visions of regionalism that have an effect on regional outlooks in Eurasia. The first one, the Russian led regionalism institutionalized under Eurasian Economic Union, and CSS. The second one is EU’s aspirational regionalism that can be found aspirations of the countries for joining the EU. The last and recent one is China led Belt and Road Initiative. Thus, in this regional dynamics, the EU does not just conduct inter-regional relations but also actively rivals those ROs.

There is a historical context, especially in terms of security through NATO, of the EU’s transatlantic relations with the USA. The trade is also an important dynamic. However, there are strong indicators of changing these dynamics, which brings us to question of the relationship. In that sense, this lecture deals with many of the contemporary side of the EU and US trans-regional relations. Areas of economic cooperation and tension will be studied, including the financial crisis, international trade and regulatory affairs, and the failed negotiation of a transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  The course will also take up cooperative and conflicting policies of transatlantic partners in addressing security problems of terrorism, failed states, refugees and human rights catastrophes.

During this phase, there will be implementation of 36 (108 hours) lectures and 36 (108 hours) seminars given by the project team.\nThe main objective of the methodological approach(es) employed in teaching activities is to provide a greater theoretical appreciation of the changing nature of regionalism and importance of inter-regional and trans-regional relations in EU studies. To this end, the project team will conduct both an analytical and conceptual investigation of the issue and develop a conceptual and historical approach to the study of EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations. Our teaching will focus on the following research topics: - definition of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - theories and approaches of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - causes and outcomes of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - different cases of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - analysis of EU’s inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism with different cases."
