    "text": "Implementation phase goes through the Spring Semester 2022 up to Spring Semester 2025 (total of 3 years). During this phase, there will be implementation of 36 (108 hours) lectures and 36 (108 hours) seminars given by the project team.\nThe main objective of the methodological approach(es) employed in teaching activities is to provide a greater theoretical appreciation of the changing nature of regionalism and importance of inter-regional and trans-regional relations in EU studies. To this end, the project team will conduct both an analytical and conceptual investigation of the issue and develop a conceptual and historical approach to the study of EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations. Our teaching will focus on the following research topics: - definition of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - theories and approaches of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - causes and outcomes of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism, - different cases of inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism - analysis of EU’s inter-regionalism and trans-regionalism with different cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Regionalism and EU\nProf. in charge: Prof. Erhan Dogan\nDescription: This course is an introductory course on the phenomenon of regionalism by taking the EU as both reference case study for regional cooperation and as an international policy actor strengthening multi-layered multilateral cooperation. The lecture starts with the fact that globalization and regionalism are now not only economic but also multidimensional and political processes. In this sense, to understand the role of the EU in this new environment, we have to go beyond classical approaches and understanding of regionalism.\n\nRegionalism: A conceptual Framework\nTheoretical Discussions on Regionalism I: Classic Theories\nTheoretical Discussions on Regionalism II: Critical Theories\nEU as a Regional Integration I: 1945-1990\nEU as a Regional Integration II: 1990-2008\nEU as a Regional Integration III: What lies Ahead?\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: Inter-regionalism\nProf. in charge: Assoc.

Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: EU’s relations with ASEAN is not straight and smooth even though it is the oldest dialog partnership for ASEAN. This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s inter-regional relations with ASEAN, which is institutionalized as ASEM. During the course of the lecture, other inter-regional dialogue such as ARF and APEC will also be analysed and compared to ASEM in terms of their structure, outcomes and future risks and possibilities.\n\nEU’s economic relations with Asia\nEU’s political and security relations with Asia\nASEAN as an Asian regional organization\nEU and ASEAN partnership: ASEM\nOther institutions and actors\nAPEC, ARF and ASEM: Similarities and Differences.\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: EU-BRICS-MIKTA\nProf. in charge: Prof. Emel Parlar Dal\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on the growing relations between EU and other groupings of rising powers, namely BRICS and MIKTA. The role of these informal groups has been increasing since the 2008 financial crisis. Especially, studying these groups and their effects on the global economy and global governance via G20, and UN has become one of the most important dynamics in international politics. This lecture will analyse EU’s policy with regard to BRICS and MIKTA by taking G20 and UN as an operational ground.\n\nWhat is BRICS? 2. What is MIKTA?\nWhat types of roles BRICS and MIKTA play in global governance?\nWhat are the similarities and differences between these groups?\nEU’s policy options\nComparison of EU’S policy in G20 with BRICS and MIKTA\nComparison of EU’S policy in UN with BRICS and MIKTA.\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: Inter-regional Relations between EU and North and Latin America\nProf. in charge: Assoc. Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on inter-regional relations between EU and North America. Euro-Atlantic relations are historically very important and institutionalized one even though there are rifts and problems between the US and some EU countries. The recent EU-Canada FTAs is also important in this sense. However, there are very little, if there is at all, inter-regional relations between the EU and NAFTA (UMSCA). That also derives from the fact that NAFTA and EU is totally different phase of regionalism (one is a regional FTA while the other is a full-regional-integration). However, this is very different when it comes to EU and Latin American Relations. European Union Member States and the Latin American countries committed themselves to reinforcing the existing strategic partnership between the European Union and Latin America. Thus, this lecture will cover both EU’s relations with individual North American countries (Mexico, Canada but not the US since it is dealt with another lecture in this series) and EU’s interregional relations with Latin America. The focus will be on the later.\n\nEU’s Transatlantic Relations: Dynamics and Evolution\nComprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA): Why is it important?\nWhat happened to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?\nHistorical evolution of regionalisms in Latin America and the Caribbean\nEU and Central America\nEU and Andean Community\nEU and CARICOM 8.

Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s inter-regional relations with Eurasian ROs including the new emerging Chinese Belt and Road Initiatives. Eurasia is a fertile ground for geo-political rivalry not just in terms of security and politics but also trade and regionalism. In this sense, there are three rival visions of regionalism that have an effect on regional outlooks in Eurasia. The first one, the Russian led regionalism institutionalized under Eurasian Economic Union, and CSS. The second one is EU’s aspirational regionalism that can be found aspirations of the countries for joining the EU. The last and recent one is China led Belt and Road Initiative. Thus, in this regional dynamics, the EU does not just conduct inter-regional relations but also actively rivals those ROs. This lecture provides a fresh perspective to analyse the actors, dynamics and outputs of EU’s inter-regional relations in Eurasia.\n\nEurasia: Theory and Practice of Regional Integration\nRegionalism and Energy Politics in Eurasia\nRegionalism and Great Powers in Eurasia\nEU’s role as a ROs in fostering cooperation and competition\nEU’s inter-regional Relations: EU and EEU\nIndividual EU countries and Chinese BRI.\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: Trans-regional Relations between EU and USA\nProf. in charge: Assoc. Prof. İmran Demir\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on the EU and the USA trans-regional relations. There is a historical context, especially in terms of security through NATO, of the EU’s transatlantic relations with the USA. The trade is also an important dynamic. However, there are strong indicators of changing these dynamics, which brings us to question of the relationship. In that sense, this lecture deals with many of the contemporary side of the EU and US trans-regional relations. Areas of economic cooperation and tension will be studied, including the financial crisis, international trade and regulatory affairs, and the failed negotiation of a transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  The course will also take up cooperative and conflicting policies of transatlantic partners in addressing security problems of terrorism, failed states, refugees and human rights catastrophes. The lecture will also focus on the EU, US and UK relations in the post-Brexit era.\n\nThe history of the EU and US relations\nThe trade diplomacy of trans-Atlantic relations\nThe role of the United States and the European Union in foreign affairs, and the overall aims of US and EU foreign policy: Security and Broader external and Foreign Relations\nThe Technology and Environmental aspects of trans-Atlantic relations\nOpportunities and challenges lies ahead in the trans-Atlantic relations\nThe US-EU and UK relations in the post-Brexit period: The implications of Brexit for future UK, US, and EU foreign policy.\n\nA Detailed Content & Reading List\n\n\n\nTitle: Trans-regional Relations between EU and China\nProf. in charge: Prof. Çağdaş Üngör Sunar\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s trans-regional relations with China. The EU and China have a deep and comprehensive partnership over many different areas and Sino-European relations have become one of the most important relations over the last decade with growing trans-regional relations in many different subjects from security to technology.\n\nThe Sino-European Relations: A historical Background\nNew challenges, new opportunities, new approaches in Sino-European Relations\nThe trade relations between EU and China\nThe high politics: A shared Multilateralism Perspective\nMapping Chinese Investment in Europe and evaluating its impact\nChina, a strategic partner or a rival? 7.

Prof. Hakan Mehmetcik\nDescription: This lecture is an introductory lecture on EU’s relations with Ros in Africa. The first and most important African Ros, is African Union. The EU has very substantial relations with African Union and many other sub-regional organizations from trade to peacekeeping missions. Africa is a very important continent with a huge potential. Rise of the rising powers is also an important strategic issue that affects the EU’s core strategies toward Africa. In this sense, EU’s inter-regional relations have to be comprehensively studied in the current environment. To this end, this lecture provides tools and readings for EU’s inter-regional relations with African ROs.\n\nConceptualizing Regionalism in Africa\nMain ROs in Africa 3.

    "text": "EUITREL’s central theme is to examine the impacts of EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations on world politics by studying and teaching the subject. The rationale behind this project is that we are currently witnessing a transition from the classical Westphalian world order to a world order where regions – next to states – play a central role and where processes of regional integration increasingly shape international relations. This transition is linked to a series of transformations in the nature and scope of regional integration processes. After a first generation of regional integration that focused primarily upon trade and regional integration, a second generation – often referred to as ‘new regionalism’ – broadened regional integration to internal policies and regulations. Today, a third generation of regionalism is emerging that emphasizes the role of regions as global actors. However, there are very few studies that compare and contrast the whole body of inter-regional (region-to region) and trans-regional (region-to-third countries) relations, and almost none in terms of special teaching course. Departing from the lacuna in the literature and the practice, this project aims: i) to teach EU’s inter-regional and trans-regional relations ii) to study inter-regional and trans-regional relations in comparative way, iii) disseminate that knowledge to other interested individuals and entities (i.e. universities, think-tanks etc.) MA and BA students along with university academic and teaching personnel as well as policymakers are the main target group for the EUITREL. EUITREL’s activities aim to provide active outreach to a broader society beyond academia.\n\n\n\nReuse@HakanMehmetcikCitationBibTeX citation:@online{mehmetcik2022,\n  author = {Hakan Mehmetcik},\n  title = {Euitrel: {The} {EU’s} {Inter-regional} and {Trans-Regional}\n    {Relations}},\n  date = {2022-09-02},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHakan Mehmetcik. 2022. “Euitrel: The EU’s Inter-Regional and\nTrans-Regional Relations.” September 2, 2022."
