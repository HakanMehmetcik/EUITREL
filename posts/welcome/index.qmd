EUITREL's central theme is to examine the impacts of EU's inter-regional and trans-regional relations on world politics by studying and teaching the subject. The rationale behind this project is that we are currently witnessing a transition from the classical Westphalian world order to a world order where regions -- next to states -- play a central role and where processes of regional integration increasingly shape international relations. This transition is linked to a series of transformations in the nature and scope of regional integration processes. After a first generation of regional integration that focused primarily upon trade and regional integration, a second generation -- often referred to as 'new regionalism' -- broadened regional integration to internal policies and regulations. Today, a third generation of regionalism is emerging that emphasizes the role of regions as global actors. However, there are very few studies that compare and contrast the whole body of inter-regional (region-to region) and trans-regional (region-to-third countries) relations, and almost none in terms of special teaching course. Departing from the lacuna in the literature and the practice, this project aims: i) to teach EU's inter-regional and trans-regional relations ii) to study inter-regional and trans-regional relations in comparative way, iii) disseminate that knowledge to other interested individuals and entities (i.e.Â universities, think-tanks etc.) MA and BA students along with university academic and teaching personnel as well as policymakers are the main target group for the EUITREL. EUITREL's activities aim to provide active outreach to a broader society beyond academia.
